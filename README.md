# 📊 NTU Supply Chain Performance Dashboard (FYP)

This repository contains the final deliverables for a Final Year Project at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), focused on developing an integrated supply chain performance dashboard using Tableau, Python, and synthetic data engineering.

## 📌 Project Summary

The dashboard enables supply chain managers and analysts to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) across inventory, supplier performance, and demand forecasting dimensions. Custom datasets were engineered to simulate realistic operations based on publicly available retail data.

This project aimed to:
- Integrate multiple supply chain functions into one cohesive monitoring system
- Generate missing features such as unit price, inventory flow, and lead times
- Design a scalable Tableau dashboard for visual insight and interactivity
- Support forecasting through synthetic historical data and time-series modeling
